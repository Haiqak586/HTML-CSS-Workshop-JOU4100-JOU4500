              <h2>Morning walk</h2>
            <p>Just as the morning walk is important for early day routine start-up, it is necessary to inhale nature's air and nature's views. Nature can be enjoyed anywhere adn everywhere: Going to office or school and returning.

            <p>There is a problem in making up for the Covid-19 routines. Because social distancing is necessary, it is important to stay away from people. In this case, too, you may go outside in the mornign when least people are out or they are using different tracks t0 walk on.In the later mornign especially on working days, there is a lot of noise and traffic. People are going to offices adn children and adults to schools, colleges adn universitites. this makes the atmosphere disturbing, but before that when the atmosphere is free of noise and air pollution for the dust, it is  better choice to go outside and have some fresh air.</p>
              <h2>Health is Wealth</h2>
            <p>People should look after their diet which depends upon their mood. To maintain your good mood or attain it, it is necessary to make a habit of inhaling pure air. This will be the time spent with yourself which necessary too. Later in the day, your mood will be calm and in place. You will love the things you normally would have hated like your office work, home work or anything that requires effort.</p>

            <p>Morning walk is so important for health. It boosts metabolism and allows more hunger for eating the right amount of food for the right time. Good metabolism enhances the physical grooming and relaxes the internal body systems. The better the metabolism, the better is the outside texture of the body.The dew drops in the morning time are good for the eye sight and a walk on the grass gives a peaceful feeling to the eyes. The fresh green grass is good for eye sight to walk on. So, it would not be wrong to say that secrets of the morning has marvels to reveal. There is less air and noise pollution to interrupt our senses. </p>
