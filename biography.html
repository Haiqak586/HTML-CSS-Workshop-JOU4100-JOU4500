            <h1>About me</h1>
              <p>My name is Haiqa Khattak. I live in Ottawa, Canada. I am studying in Digital Journalsim program at the University of Ottawa. I am originally from Pakistan. I came to Canada in 2015. I studied in Journalism Program at algonquin College and continued it at University of Ottawa. I want to become confident and open to learn new things whcih I am having a hard time to do at this point in life. After coming to Canada, I didn't attend school, and was not very familiar with the kind of education here. I think that now I am leaning to adjust to the different education style, but I still am not confident in speaking and about sharing my opinions.</p>
            <p>I want to be an opinionated person and share my opinions on public platforms such as Twitter. I aspire to become a journalist to serve my country because I think there is a need for a person who can speak up for the injustices of the society and not only speak out the right from wrong, but also seek justice.</p>
              <h2>My aspirations</h2>
            <p>I also want to write about life and how I feel about it. I want to share my experiences of life and I want people to relate to those situations and know that how I came through and gor over those situations. I know poeple go through such situations and develop their experiences. They might not need some self-help books at that time.</p>
            <p>I dont like talking much. This is because my mood is not good most of the time. At this point in life, I feel that so much talking has been done, but then I think that so much action is done as well. What is next I wonder. I don't find attraction in things any more. It might be because I am not confident about my capabilities and that I am so sensitive to forget what has been done and I didn't play a part in that.</p>
