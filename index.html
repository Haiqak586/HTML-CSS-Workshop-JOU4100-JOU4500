            <h2>Mind Relaxation</h2>
            <p>First of all, morning walk brings a sense of relaxation and a courage to enter the hectic daily routine. It boosts one's capacity to do hard tasks. Because it enhances good mood, a person is more willing to jump into difficult tasks. Secondly, it helps the body to digest the already eaten food which helps in body weight loss and absorption of useful nutrients in the blood. This brings relaxation and lightness in the mood. It is a good habit to sleep early in the night and wake up early to be able to go for a morning walk.</p>
            <p>Walk in the summers is easy comparatively. In winters it is not feasible to walk on the snowy paths when teeth are alreay cluttering from cold. The morning walk habit can be developed in the summers and it will become habitual to walk in winters too.</p>
            <h2>Muscle Fatigue Prevention</h2>
            <p>A walk in the morning or in the evening helps the muscles to contract and relax which prevents uric acid accumulation in the body. This results in acive body muscles and a result less pain in the muscles in older age. Often young people develop a kind of muscle pain called Myalgia. </p>
                <p>What is Myalgia?</p>

                </ul>
              <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia">
            In medicine, "myalgia", also known as muscle pain or muscle ache, is a symptom that presents with a large array of diseases. While the most common cause is the overuse of a muscle or  group of muscles, acute myalgia may also be due to viral infections, especially in the absence of a traumatic history. Long-term myalgias may be indicative of a metabolic myopathy, some nutritional deficiencies, or chronic fatigue syndrome. 
              </blockquote>
        <p>It is suggested by nutritionists and physiotherapists to make a habit of morning walk. To maintain healthy life style, the habit of waking up early and going to bed early at the night shall be made a routine. </p>
